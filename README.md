# fsai_sim_training

The aim of this repo is to guide you through setting up an initial ROS2 workspace to the point where you can run the Warwick fsai simulator and start understanding how ROS2 works at the level of actually running systems.

These instructions assume that you have a basic understanding on the Linux terminal.
